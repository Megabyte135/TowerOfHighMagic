# Project: Tower of High Magic
## Concept
Role-playing computer game on the Unity engine in the fantasy/dungeon-crawling genre. Get into a tower on the ruins of a fallen kingdom, fight its mysterious inhabitants, collect treasures and get to the bottom of the truth about the cataclysm that hit these lands!
## Implemented features
During development I used: the Unity engine, the C# programming language, xNode packages (for working with graphs) and Json.NET (for parsing json files used for saves).
Has a ready-to-use dialog system.
## Sidenotes
My graduation project, which never went beyond a crude prototype.
For the most part I'm happy with the result. The project could have been made better by changing approaches to connections between objects - using, for example, DI frameworks instead of the Singletone pattern. However, the tight deadlines did not allow us to fully master the necessary frameworks, and therefore we have what we have.
The codebase is most interesting because all other aspects (textures, models, sounds, UI design) were created using free assets from the Unity Asset Store, so in order to focus on what's important and save space on GitHub servers, the remaining gigabytes of the project were discarded.
In addition, the project never had a need to create a dynamically generated settings menu (and now I understand how many restrictions it imposes), but I was too caught up in trying my hand at reflection not to try.
